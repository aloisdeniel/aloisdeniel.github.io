# Me

I am a french Cross Platform Mobile Developer working at Orange Business Services in Rennes, France. The tools I use everyday are mainly the Google (Flutter, Firebase) and Microsoft (Visual Studio, TFS, .NET, Xamarin, UWP) ones, but I love discovering other areas on my spare time : design (Photoshop, Sketch), video game development (LÃ–VE, MonoGame, SDL), web backend development (Node.js, Azure, Firebase), web frontend development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript).
